                    <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                    <p>Tigers are the largest and most powerful members of the cat family, known for their striking orange coats with black stripes. They are native to various parts of Asia, including India, Russia, and Southeast Asia. Tigers are solitary animals that primarily hunt large prey such as deer and wild boar, using their strength and stealth to ambush their targets.</p>
                    <p>At Pine City Zoo, we are committed to the conservation and protection of tigers. Our tiger exhibit provides a safe and enriching environment for these majestic creatures, allowing visitors to learn about their behavior, diet, and the challenges they face in the wild. We also support various conservation initiatives aimed at preserving tiger populations and their habitats across Asia.</p>
