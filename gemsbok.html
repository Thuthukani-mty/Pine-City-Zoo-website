                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope species native to the arid regions of Southern Africa. Known for its striking appearance, the gemsbok has a light brown or grayish coat with distinctive black and white markings on its face, legs, and underbelly.
                    <p>Gemsboks are well-adapted to their harsh desert environment, capable of surviving with minimal water intake. They can obtain moisture from the plants they consume and are known to dig for roots and tubers during dry periods. These antelopes are herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses, leaves, and shrubs.
                    <p>At Pine City Zoo, we are committed to the conservation and protection of gemsboks and their natural habitats. Our gemsbok exhibit provides a safe and enriching environment for these magnificent creatures, allowing visitors to learn about their behavior, social structure, and the challenges they face in the wild. We also support various conservation initiatives aimed at preserving gemsbok populations and their ecosystems.</p>
                    <p>Come visit our gemsbok exhibit and experience the beauty and resilience of these remarkable antelopes up close. Our knowledgeable staff are always available to answer any questions you may have and provide insights into the fascinating world of gemsboks.</p>
