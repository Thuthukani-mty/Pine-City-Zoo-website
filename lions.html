                    <h3>LIONS</h3>
                    <p>Lions are majestic and powerful big cats known for their strength, courage, and social behavior. They are native to the savannas and grasslands of Africa, where they live in groups called prides. Lions are easily recognizable by their muscular build, tawny fur, and the distinctive mane that adorns the majestic creature.</p>
                    <p>At Pine City Zoo, we are dedicated to the conservation and protection of lions. Our lion exhibit provides a safe and enriching environment for these magnificent creatures, allowing visitors to learn about their behavior, social structure, and the challenges they face in the wild. We also support various conservation initiatives aimed at protecting lion populations and their habitats across Africa.</p>
                    <p>Come visit our lion exhibit and experience the awe-inspiring presence of these magnificent creatures up close. Our knowledgeable staff are always available to answer any questions you may have and provide insights into the fascinating world of lions.</p>
