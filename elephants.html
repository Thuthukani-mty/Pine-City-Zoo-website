                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. They are known for their intelligence, strong social bonds, and impressive memory. Elephants use their trunks for a variety of tasks, including drinking water, picking up objects, and communicating with other elephants. They are herbivores and spend a significant amount of time foraging for food. Elephants play a crucial role in their ecosystems by helping to maintain the balance of plant life and creating habitats for other species.</p>
                    <p>At Pine City Zoo, we are dedicated to the conservation and protection of elephants. Our elephant exhibit provides a safe and enriching environment for these magnificent creatures, allowing visitors to learn about their behavior, social structure, and the challenges they face in the wild. We also support various conservation initiatives aimed at protecting elephant populations and their habitats around the world.</p>
                    <p>Come visit our elephant exhibit and experience the awe-inspiring presence of these gentle giants up close. Our knowledgeable staff are always available to answer any questions you may have and provide insights into the fascinating world of elephants.</p>
