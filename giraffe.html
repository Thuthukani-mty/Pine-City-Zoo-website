                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, known for their long necks and distinctive spotted coats. They are native to the savannas and open woodlands of Africa, where they primarily feed on leaves, flowers, and fruits from tall trees such as acacias. Giraffes have a unique way of walking, moving both legs on one side of their body at the same time, which gives them a graceful and fluid motion.</p>
                    <p>At Pine City Zoo, we are dedicated to the conservation and protection of giraffes. Our giraffe exhibit provides a safe and enriching environment for these magnificent creatures, allowing visitors to learn about their behavior, social structure, and the challenges they face in the wild. We also support various conservation initiatives aimed at protecting giraffe populations and their habitats across Africa.</p>
                    <p>Come visit our giraffe exhibit and experience the awe-inspiring presence of these gentle giants up close. Our knowledgeable staff are always available to answer any questions you may have and provide insights into the fascinating world of giraffes.</p>
