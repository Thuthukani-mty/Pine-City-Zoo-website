                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <p>Gorillas are the largest primates in the world and are known for their strength, intelligence, and social behavior. They are native to the forests of central Africa and live in groups called troops, which are led by a dominant.
                    <p>At Pine City Zoo, we are dedicated to the conservation and protection of gorillas. Our gorilla exhibit provides a safe and enriching environment for these magnificent creatures, allowing visitors to learn about their behavior, social structure, and the challenges they face in the wild. We also support various conservation initiatives aimed at protecting gorilla populations and their habitats across Africa.</p>
                    <p>Come visit our gorilla exhibit and experience the awe-inspiring presence of these gentle giants up close. Our knowledgeable staff are always available to answer any questions you may have and provide insights into the fascinating world of gorillas.</p>
