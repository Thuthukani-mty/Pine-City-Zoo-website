                    <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                    <p>Warthogs are wild members of the pig family native to Africa, easily recognizable by their distinctive facial warts and curved tusks. They have a robust build, with a large head, a mane of hair running down their back, and a sparse covering of bristly hair. Warthogs are well-adapted to their savanna and grassland habitats, where they primarily feed on grasses, roots, and tubers.</p>
                    <p>At Pine City Zoo, we are dedicated to the conservation and protection of warthogs. Our warthog exhibit provides a safe and enriching environment for these fascinating creatures, allowing visitors to learn about their behavior, diet, and the challenges they face in the wild. We also support various conservation initiatives aimed at preserving warthog populations and their habitats across Africa.</p>
                    <p>Come visit our warthog exhibit and experience the unique charm of these resilient animals up close. Our knowledgeable staff are always available to answer any questions you may have and provide insights into the captivating world of warthogs.</p>
