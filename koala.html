                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p>Koalas are arboreal marsupials native to Australia, known for their distinctive appearance and tree-dwelling lifestyle. They have a stout, tailless body covered in thick, gray fur, large ears, and a prominent black nose. Koalas are primarily nocturnal and spend most of their time sleeping in the branches of eucalyptus trees, which also serve as their main source of food.</p>
                    <p>At Pine City Zoo, we are dedicated to the conservation and protection of koalas. Our koala exhibit provides a safe and enriching environment for these adorable creatures, allowing visitors to learn about their behavior, diet, and the challenges they face in the wild. We also support various conservation initiatives aimed at preserving koala populations and their habitats across Australia.</p>
                    <p>Come visit our koala exhibit and experience the charm and uniqueness of these fascinating animals up close. Our knowledgeable staff are always available to answer any questions you may have and provide insights into the captivating world of koalas.</p>
