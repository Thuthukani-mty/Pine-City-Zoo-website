                    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                    <p>Pandas, also known as giant pandas, are beloved creatures native to the mountainous regions of central China. They are easily recognizable by their distinctive black and white fur pattern, which provides excellent camouflage in their natural habitat. Pandas primarily feed on bamboo, which makes up the majority of their diet, although they may occasionally consume other vegetation and small animals.</p>
                    <p>At Pine City Zoo, we are committed to the conservation and protection of pandas. Our panda exhibit offers a safe and enriching environment for these gentle giants, allowing visitors to learn about their behavior, diet, and the challenges they face in the wild. We also support various conservation initiatives aimed at preserving panda populations and their habitats in China.</p>
                    <p>Come visit our panda exhibit and experience the charm and uniqueness of these fascinating animals up close. Our knowledgeable staff are always available to answer any questions you may have and provide insights into the captivating world of pandas.</p>
